# Portfolio
A Portfolio of Projects

## Description 
This website is a virtual portfolio containing deployed samples of my projects as a website developer. This portfolio was created for potential employers to have access to samples of projects. This will make it easier for them to assess the many projects at once with one link, rather than sending them many links of all the different projects.
